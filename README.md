# SMART Open Network & SMART Task

**SMART Open Network** is a decentralized platform that offers tasks, gaming experiences, and opportunities for users to earn rewards in **SMART tokens**. With the **SMART Task** system deployed on the **Koii Network**, users can participate in various blockchain-based tasks to earn rewards while contributing to the growth of the network.

## Overview

- **SMART Open Network**: A decentralized ecosystem where participants can complete tasks, earn tokens, and play blockchain-based games like the **SmartClicking Game**.
- **SMART Task**: A task system that allows users to complete specific tasks on the **Koii Network**, earn **SMART tokens**, and engage in blockchain validation.

## Key Features

- **SMART Tokens**: Utility tokens that users earn for completing tasks, playing games, or contributing to the network.
- **SmartClicking Game**: A blockchain-based game where users can earn tokens by completing clicks and actions.
- **SMART Task on Koii Network**: A decentralized task system where participants complete tasks, validate data, and contribute to the blockchain while earning **SMART tokens**.

## Benefits of Participating

- Earn **SMART tokens** for completing blockchain tasks.
- Early participants receive bonus rewards for engaging in the **SMART Task**.
- Use **SMART tokens** for staking, governance, or in-game features.
- Join a growing decentralized ecosystem and help validate blockchain tasks.

## Getting Started with SMART Task

### 1. Requirements

- A **Koii Node** to participate in tasks.
- A supported **crypto wallet** to store and manage **SMART tokens**.

### 2. How to Participate

#### Set up a Koii Node
Follow [Koii Network](https://koii.network/) instructions to set up your own Koii Node. This is essential to participate in **SMART Task** validation.

#### Start Earning
Once your node is running, you can start completing tasks on the **SMART Task**. The tasks involve validating data or actions submitted by other users, with opportunities to earn **SMART tokens**.

### 3. Validation Process

As a participant, your role is to:

- Complete tasks (such as validating game data or blockchain actions).
- Submit proofs of task completion on-chain.
- Earn **SMART tokens** based on your contributions and accuracy.

## How SMART Task Works

### Task Submission:
Tasks are submitted by the system or users and are posted on the **Koii Network** for validation. Participants can join the validation round to help verify the correctness of tasks.

### Task Validation:
Validators audit the submitted data against the stored game data or blockchain activity to ensure accuracy. If the data is valid, it is approved, and participants are rewarded.

### Reward Distribution:
After completing tasks, participants earn **SMART tokens**. Early participants in the **SMART Task** will receive bonus tokens for their involvement.

## SMART Token Utility

- **Staking**: Lock your **SMART tokens** to earn more rewards or gain voting power in the governance of the network.
- **Gaming**: Use your **SMART tokens** in the **SmartClicking Game** to unlock in-game features, boost your earnings, and more.
- **Governance**: Participate in voting on the future direction of the **SMART Open Network**.

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Launch of **SMART Task** on **Koii Network** for task validation and token rewards.
- **Phase 2**: Expansion of the **SmartClicking Game** with new features and additional reward opportunities.
- **Phase 3**: Integration with DeFi platforms to allow staking, lending, and borrowing of **SMART tokens**.
- **Phase 4**: Partnerships with complementary blockchain platforms to increase exposure and utility of **SMART tokens**.
